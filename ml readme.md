## 🌾 First Model: Irrigation Prediction Model

### 📋 Overview
An intelligent machine learning system that predicts irrigation needs for agricultural fields based on real-time environmental sensor data and crop characteristics. The model helps optimize water usage, reduce waste, and improve crop yields through precision agriculture.

### 🎯 Key Features
- **95% Accuracy** in predicting irrigation needs
- **Balanced Dataset** with careful handling of class imbalance
- **6 Environmental Features** for comprehensive analysis
- **XGBoost Algorithm** for robust predictions
- **Domain Knowledge Integration** with crop-specific thresholds

### 🔧 Model Architecture

### Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier

**Why XGBoost?**
- Handles non-linear relationships well
- Robust to outliers
- Built-in feature importance
- Efficient with tabular data
- No need for feature scaling

### 📊 Input Features

| Feature | Type | Range | Description |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| `soil_moisture` | Float | 0-100% | Current soil water content |
| `temperature` | Float | 10-45°C | Ambient air temperature |
| `humidity` | Float | 20-90% | Relative air humidity |
| `rainfall` | Float | 0-76mm | Recent precipitation |
| `sunlight_intensity` | Float | 0-1200 W/m² | Solar radiation level |
| `soil_pH` | Float | 5.5-8.5 | Soil acidity/alkalinity |

**Output:** Binary classification (0 = No irrigation, 1 = Irrigation needed)

### 📈 Dataset Details

### Composition
```
dataset
├── Class 0 (No irrigation)
└── Class 1 (Irrigation needed)
```

### Data Source
1. **Simulated Sensor Data**
   - Simulated farm IoT sensor readings
   - Timestamped measurements
   - Multiple crop types and regions

### Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
1. Load raw sensor data
2. Apply irrigation logic to create labels
3. Handle missing values (dropna)
4. Balance classes (original + synthetic)
5. Train-test split (80-20, stratified)
6. Train XGBoost model
```

## 🧮 Irrigation Logic

### Rule-Based Labeling System

**Base Moisture Thresholds (by crop):**
```python
thresholds = {
    'Potato': 60%,   # High water needs
    'Rice': 40%,     # Medium-high needs
    'Tomato': 30%,   # Medium needs
    'Peanuts': 30%,
    'Olive': 25%,    # Low needs
    'Barley': 25%,
    'Onion': 25%,
    'Corn': 25%,
    'Wheat': 20%,    # Very low needs
    'Dates': 20%
}
```

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
```python
if temperature > 30°C:    threshold += 3%
if humidity < 40%:        threshold += 2%
if sunlight > 800 W/m²:   threshold += 2%
if rainfall > 2mm:        return 0  # Override: No irrigation
```

**Decision Logic:**
```
irrigation_needed = 1 if soil_moisture < adjusted_threshold else 0
```

## 📊 Model Performance
### Key Metrics Explained
- **Accuracy: 95%** - Overall correct predictions
- **Precision (Irrigation): 94%** - When model says "irrigate", it's right 94% of the time
- **Recall (Irrigation): 97%** - Model catches 97% of cases that need irrigation
- **F1-Score: 0.96** - Excellent balance between precision and recall

## 🎯 Feature Importance

Based on XGBoost analysis:

```
soil_moisture       ████████████████████ (Highest)
temperature         ███████████████
rainfall            ████████████
humidity            █████████
sunlight_intensity  ███████
soil_pH             ███
```

**Insights:**
- Soil moisture is the dominant factor (as expected)
- Temperature significantly affects water evaporation
- Rainfall has strong negative correlation
- pH has minimal direct impact
