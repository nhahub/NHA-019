---
## 🗺️ Step 0: Generate and Prepare Sensor Data
### Understanding the Data Source

Before diving into the real-time pipeline, it's essential to understand where the data originates and how it's prepared for streaming. In a production agricultural IoT system, physical sensors deployed across farms would continuously measure environmental conditions and transmit readings to a central platform. However, for development, testing, and demonstration purposes, we simulate this sensor network using a data generation script that creates realistic agricultural data patterns.

### The Farm Network Setup

The data generation process simulates a network of **10 farms** distributed across 3 major agricultural regions in Egypt. Each farm is configured with specific characteristics that influence its sensor readings:

**🌊 Nile Delta Region (3 farms)** Wheat, rice, onions | High humidity, moderate temps

**🏜️ Upper Egypt Region (3 farms)** Tomatoes, dates, peanuts | Desert heat, low rainfall

**⛰️ Sinai Region (4 farms)** Corn, olives, barley, potatoes | Unique microclimate

### 🔄Realistic Sensor Data Simulation

Year-long (2024) minute-by-minute data modeling environmental interactions and agricultural practices.

## Key Variables 
**Sunlight:** 6 AM-6 PM, noon peak, seasonal variation

**Temperature:** 18-22°C (winter) to 28-35°C (summer), daily/regional fluctuations

**Soil Moisture:** Evapotranspiration loss, rainfall gain, irrigation at <20%

**Rainfall:** 1.4% probability/minute, 10-80mm amounts

**Humidity:** 55% base, adjusted for temp/rain, ±3% random

**Soil pH:** 6.0-7.0 start, rain/pesticides lower it, moisture raises it

**Pesticides:** 70% after rain, weekly routine, 5-20ml

---
## 🚀 Step 1: Launch the Container Infrastructure

The entire technology stack runs as Docker containers orchestrated by Docker Compose. This approach ensures consistent environments across different machines and simplifies dependency management. Instead of manually installing Kafka, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, and Spark on your machine, Docker handles all installations and configurations automatically.

### What This Step Does

The `docker-compose.yaml` file (Docker Compose configuration) defines all the services needed for the pipeline. When you run the compose command, Docker will pull the required images from Docker Hub and start multiple containers. These containers include:
### Execution Steps

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is located. Execute the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Accessing Service Web Interfaces

Once all containers are running, you can verify their functionality by accessing their web interfaces:

- **Kafka UI**: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You should see the Kafka UI dashboard, though it will show no topics yet.

- **Hadoop NameNode**: Visit http://localhost:9870 to see the HDFS web interface showing cluster overview, filesystem status, and data node information.

- **Spark Master**: Access http://localhost:8081 to view the Spark cluster status, available workers, and resource allocation.

If any of these interfaces don't load, double-check that the corresponding containers are running and that no firewall rules are blocking the ports.

---
## 💾 Step 2: Initialize the Hadoop Distributed File System

HDFS requires specific directory structures to be created before it can store data. Unlike traditional filesystems that create directories automatically, HDFS follows a more explicit initialization process. This step sets up the necessary directory hierarchy for storing your sensor data.

### Why This Step Is Necessary

HDFS organizes data in a distributed manner across multiple nodes. The `/user` directory is a convention in Hadoop ecosystems, similar to `/home` in Unix systems. Applications like Spark expect to write data to user-specific directories within `/user`. Creating these directories upfront prevents permission errors and ensures Spark can write data successfully.

### Execution Steps

First, you need to access the command-line interface inside the Hadoop NameNode container. 

The `docker exec` command runs a command inside a running container. 

Now create the necessary directory structure by running:
```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user
```
---
## 🔌 Step 3: Configure PostgreSQL Database Connection

PostgreSQL serves as the real-time database for your streaming pipeline. Before Spark can write data to PostgreSQL, you need to create the database and configure your development environment to connect to it.

- create a connetion either with vs code databasee connections of pgadmin
  this is the conncetion settings in vs code
  ![connection](images/connection.jpg)
- or use the localhost of pgadmin 
create database and name it **smart_farming**
and create the table with schema in the database

The `sensor_data` table is designed to capture comprehensive information about each sensor reading. Execute the following SQL to create the table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.sensor_data
(
    sensor_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    "timestamp" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    soil_moisture DOUBLE PRECISION,
    soil_ph DOUBLE PRECISION,
    temperature DOUBLE PRECISION,
    rainfall DOUBLE PRECISION,
    humidity DOUBLE PRECISION,
    sunlight_intensity DOUBLE PRECISION,
    pesticide_usage_ml DOUBLE PRECISION,
    farm_id VARCHAR(50),
    region VARCHAR(100),
    crop_type VARCHAR(100)
);
```
---
## 📊 Step 4: Start the Kafka Data Ingestion Pipeline

With the infrastructure ready and database prepared, it's time to start feeding data into the system. The Kafka producer reads sensor data and streams it into the Kafka topic where Spark will consume it.

open kafka ui on http://localhost:8080 to make sure that topic **'smart_farming_data'** is added.
![kafkaui](images/kafkaui.jpg)
---
## ⚡ Step 5: Launch Spark Structured Streaming

Now that data is flowing into Kafka, Spark Structured Streaming will consume these messages, process them, and write to both PostgreSQL and HDFS simultaneously.

### Understanding Spark's Dual-Write Pattern

Spark Structured Streaming operates on micro-batch processing. Every 10 seconds (the trigger interval), Spark collects all new Kafka messages, processes them as a mini-batch, and writes the results. This approach balances latency (faster than pure batch) with throughput (higher than processing each message individually). The dual-write pattern ensures data lands in both the hot path (PostgreSQL for real-time queries) and cold path (HDFS for historical analysis) with exactly-once semantics, meaning no duplicates and no data loss even if failures occur.

### Execution Steps

Open Jupyter Notebook in localhost. paste the content of `spark.ipynb` notebook.
The notebook contains several cells that:

1. **Initialize the Spark session** with necessary configurations including Kafka and PostgreSQL JDBC libraries
2. **Read from the Kafka topic** using the `readStream` API
3. **Parse JSON messages** into structured DataFrames with proper schema
4. **Apply data quality transformations** including validation, deduplication, and null handling
5. **Write to PostgreSQL** using foreachBatch to leverage JDBC
6. **Write to HDFS** in Parquet format with date-based partitioning
7. **Start the streaming queries** and await termination

Execute all cells in sequence
### Monitoring Execution

After starting the streaming queries, Spark will display status information showing it's processing data. You'll see log output indicating:

- Connection established to Kafka broker
- Number of messages read in each batch
- Number of rows written to PostgreSQL
- Number of rows written to HDFS
- Processing time for each micro-batch

The streaming queries will continue running indefinitely until you manually stop them. For testing, you can let them run for a few minutes to process several batches, then stop the notebook kernel to gracefully shut down the streams.

## ✅ Step 6: Validate Data in PostgreSQL

After Spark has been processing for a few minutes, verify that data is successfully landing in your PostgreSQL database.

### Verification Steps

Open your PostgreSQL client (VS Code or pgAdmin) and connect to the `smart_farming` database. Open a new query editor and execute:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sensor_data;
```

This query retrieves  sensor readings. If everything is working correctly, you should see rows of data with sensor IDs, timestamps, and all your sensor measurements.

  <img src="images/postgrestable.jpg" alt="PostgreSQL sensor_data table showing ingested records" />
</p>
---

## ✅ Step 7: Validate Data in HDFS

The final verification step ensures data is also being written to HDFS for long-term storage and batch processing.

### Accessing the HDFS Web Interface

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:9870 to access the Hadoop NameNode web interface. The landing page shows cluster overview including total storage capacity, used space, and data node status.

# ETL for Smart Farming Project

This part implements an ETL pipeline to process smart farming sensor data. It reads raw data from HDFS, cleans and transforms it, calculates analytics, and loads everything into a MySQL data warehouse with **incremental loading** to prevent duplicate data processing.

The goals were:
- Clean and standardize sensor data
- Handle missing values and remove extreme outliers
- Build fact and dimension tables for analytics
- Implement incremental loading using timestamp-based checkpointing
- Prevent duplicate data through Spark deduplication and MySQL constraints
- Optimize performance by processing only new data on subsequent runs

## Key Features

### Incremental Loading System
- **Checkpoint Mechanism:** Tracks the maximum timestamp of processed data in `/tmp/last_processed_timestamp.txt`
- **Smart Filtering:** Only processes records with timestamps newer than the last checkpoint
- **First Run:** Processes all historical data and saves checkpoint
- **next Runs:** Filters and processes only new data since last run
- **No New Data Detection:** Exits when no new records are available by stopping spark so that it doesn't try to continue processing and cleaning the data

## Data Output
- **Fact table:** `fact_sensor_data`
- **Dimension tables:** `dim_farm`, `dim_crop`, `dim_time`
- **Aggregated tables:** `moisture_trend`, `rain_moisture`, `climate_effect`, `ph_trend`, `rain_pesticide`, `sunlight_daily`, `pesticide_trend`

## ETL Pipeline Steps

### 1. Spark Setup
Created a Spark session for distributed data processing.

### 2. Incremental Data Reading
- **Read from HDFS:** I read the raw data from the HDFS parquet files
- **Get last processed timestamp from checkpoint:** gets only the data that wasn't loaded before


### 3. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values:** Fill numeric columns with mean values
- **Outlier Removal:** Use IQR method (Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR)
- **Deduplication:** Remove duplicate records using `dropDuplicates()`
- **Text Cleaning:** Trim whitespace from region and crop_type
- **Type Conversion:** Cast numeric fields to double, extract farm_id as integer

### 4. Feature Engineering
Extract temporal features from timestamp:
- Date, year, month, day, week, hour, minute

### 5. Dimensional Modeling

**Fact Table:**
- `fact_sensor_data`: All sensor readings with foreign keys and measurements

**Dimension Tables:**
- `dim_farm` → farm_id (PK), region
- `dim_crop` → crop_type (PK)
- `dim_time` → date, year, month, day, week, hour, minute 

**Aggregated Analytics Tables:**
- `moisture_trend` → Average soil moisture per farm per day
- `rain_moisture` → Total rainfall vs soil moisture per region per day
- `climate_effect` → Soil moisture vs temperature and sunlight per region
- `ph_trend` → Average soil pH per crop and region over time
- `rain_pesticide` → Rainfall vs pesticide usage correlation
- `sunlight_daily` → Total daily sunlight hours per region
- `pesticide_trend` → Pesticide usage trends by crop and region


- **Aggregated Tables in MySQL:**

![Aggregated tables](images/derived_tables.png)

### 6. Loading to MySQL
- **Mode:** `append` (incremental loads)
- **Column Types:** Explicitly defined using `createTableColumnTypes`
- **Constraints:** primary keys and composite keys prevent duplicates
- **JDBC Connection:** to directly write from Spark to MySQL


- **Example of the data loaded into the MySQL data warehouse (fact_sensor_data table):**

![MySQL Fact Table](images/fact_table.png)


- **The Data Star Schema (Fact and dimension tables):**

![Star Schema](images/star_schema.png)

### 7. Checkpoint Update
- **After successful load:** It updates the checkpoint with the maximum timestamp of the processed batch


## Data Integrity

### MySQL Constraints
- `dim_farm` → PRIMARY KEY (farm_id)
- `dim_crop` → PRIMARY KEY (crop_type)
- `dim_time` → Composite UNIQUE (date, hour, minute)
- `fact_sensor_data` → Composite UNIQUE (sensor_id, timestamp)

### Spark Deduplication
- `dropDuplicates()` applied on all dimension tables
- Fact table deduplicated by (sensor_id, timestamp)


## Workflow Summary
```
1. Read Parquet files from HDFS
2. Check last processed timestamp
3. Filter for new records only
4. Clean and transform data
5. Create fact/dimension tables
6. Load to MySQL (append mode)
7. Update checkpoint with new max timestamp
8. Next run processes only data after checkpoint
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Optimal Conditions (Should be Healthy)
```python
{
    "soil_pH": 6.5,              # Perfect neutral
    "soil_moisture": 50,         # Ideal
    "temperature": 22,           # Mild
    "humidity": 80,              # Great
    "rainfall": 6,               # Good
    "pesticide_usage_ml": 0,     # None
    "crop_type": "Rice",
    "region": "NileDelta"
}
# Expected: 0.70+ (🟢 Healthy)
```

### Scenario 2: Poor Conditions (Should be Poor)
```python
{
    "soil_pH": 8.0,              # Too alkaline
    "soil_moisture": 30,         # Dry
    "temperature": 35,           # Hot
    "humidity": 20,              # Very dry
    "rainfall": 0,               # No rain
    "pesticide_usage_ml": 15,    # High
    "crop_type": "Tomato",
    "region": "UpperEgypt"
}
# Expected: 0.10-0.20 (🔴 Poor)
```

### Scenario 3: Moderate Conditions
```python
{
    "soil_pH": 6.1,              # Slightly acidic
    "soil_moisture": 48,         # Near optimal
    "temperature": 25,           # Good
    "humidity": 55,              # Decent
    "rainfall": 4,               # Adequate
    "pesticide_usage_ml": 2,     # Low
    "crop_type": "Olive",
    "region": "Sinai"
}
# Expected: 0.65-0.70 (🟡 Moderate)
```
